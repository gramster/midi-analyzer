The detection code exists in harmony/chords.py (detect_chord_progression_for_song), but it's not being called from the GUI. Add chord progression display to either the Metadata/Info tab or the Sections tab (where it makes contextual sense). Show both the chord names and Roman numeral analysis relative to the detected key.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"gram@geekraver.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T20:11:16.999864-08:00","created_by":"geekraver","updated_at":"2026-01-18T20:44:58.333707-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-18T20:44:58.333707-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented in single commit: stop on song switch, chord progression display, pattern mining display, piano roll scroll, lowered arp threshold"}
